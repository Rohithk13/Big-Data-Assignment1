## Big-Data-Assignment1
### 1. What is big data with example and types

The Combination of Unstructured, Semi-structured and Structured data collected by different Organizations is known as Big Data. Also, it refers to that it is impossible to process the large, fast or complex and difficult data in Traditional methods.

In  medical field Big Data is used to find the disease risk factors or by doctors to find patients illness is an example for Big Data

Types of Big Data are 
Structured Data :It is defined as the Data that resides in a fixed field with record.(i.e, Birthday). 
Semi- Structured Data: The data doesn’t need a structured query language, it is commonly called NoSQL data.(i.e, email). 
Unstructutred Data : Data doesnt having any regular informationn and not following the set of rules.(i.e, webpages).


### 2. 6 ‘V’s of Big Data (define each)

- Volume:  Refers to the amount of data that exists. It is like the base of Big Data, as it is the initial size and amount of collected data. If the volume of data 
           is large enough, it can be considered big data.
- Velocity: It refers to fast data is generated and moves. (i.e, Social media)
- Variety : Refers to different types of data, such as Structured, Semi-Structured and Un-Structured Data types.
- Variability :  The inconsistency present in the data and which makes it diffcult to handle and process the data is variability.
- Veracity : The Quality and Accuracy of Data are comes under Veracity. To extract value from the data, the data needs to be cleaned and noise to be removed.
- Value : It is directly related to orgaizations that collecting the data. Mainly extracting the Useful Information.
  

### 3. Phases of Big Data analysis (discuss each)
 ### Phase-1 Data Acquisition and Recording
        Data which is generated is high in Quality. Firstly, filter the data as required in order to retain the useful data for Analysis. 
- ### Phase-2 Information Extraction and Cleaning
       Next, after aquiring the data, we need to extract the useful information or Data. And send the data for Cleaning.There it finds the missing values and 
       corrects the data. 
- ### Phase-3 Data Integration, Aggregation and Representation
        Data integration generally involves combining information from many heterogeneous data. It aids in minimizing duplication and inconsistent behavior. 
         In order to facilitate understanding, data is then visualized.
- ### Phase-4 Query processing, Data modelling and  Analysis
        To obtain the relevant subsets needed for analysis, we query the Big Data. Also we build the suitable data model and the analysing the big data using 
         various methods.   
- ### Phase-5 Interpretation
         Interpreting the Data and verifying the Results, Visualizing the data gives the better Interpretation and accurate results.

  

### 4. Challenges in Big Data analysis (discuss each)
 - ### Heterogeneity and incompleteness
        Machine Learning algorithms cannot understands the small differences, for that we need to clean the data and analysis the big data to overcome the incompleteness.   
- ### Scale
        It refers to a huge growth in Data.It is challenging that every new technology is used and stored.
- ### Timeliness
        Time is also main challenge, as analysing the Big Data, it takes long time to show the results. Here we need to make new querries and new indexes gives 
        good results. 
- ### Privacy
        Data sharing and location is the biggest challenge for Privacy, Big data must overcome this. 
- ### Human Collaboration
        Almost all  inputs are computational analysis in Big Data and the Inputs from human experts will be ver helpful in analysis of big data.
